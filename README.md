# *Westbrook* | Growth Constraints and Strategic Opportunities in a Mature E-commerce Business

---

## I. Project Background

**Westbrook** is a mid-sized e-commerce brand selling approximately **50 SKUs through the Amazon Marketplace in the U.S. market**. The company has operated since **2020** and maintains a relatively **stable product portfolio with minimal assortment changes**.

### Key Business Question

Why has revenue remained stable for five years despite consistent demand and a growing e-commerce market?

This analysis evaluates **business performance between 2020 and 2024**, identifies **key growth drivers and structural constraints**, and develops **strategic recommendations for the next stage of business development**.

### Scope of Analysis

The analysis focuses on **five core business dimensions**:

* **Revenue & Growth Dynamics** — trends in Revenue, Orders, Customers, and AOV
* **Product & Category Performance** — revenue structure and portfolio concentration
* **Regional Performance** — geographic revenue distribution and operational metrics
* **Seasonality Patterns** — demand seasonality and anomalies
* **Retention & Repeat Rate** — customer base stability and repeat purchase behavior

## II. Data Structure & Validation

The dataset includes **over 100,000 transactions** covering customer purchases, product attributes, and order details.

The analytical dataset consists of **three core relational tables**:

* `orders`
* `customers`
* `products`

These tables capture the information required to analyze **revenue performance, customer behavior, and product portfolio structure**.

### Data Preparation Workflow

* **Data cleaning & transformation:** [Python](2_notebooks)
* **Relational modeling & KPI validation:** [PostgreSQL](3_sql)

See [Data Documentation](/1_data/data_documentation.md) for detailed dataset description and transformation steps.

> ### Business Impact
> * **Stagnation Source:** Revenue is capped by flat new customer acquisition.
> * **Core Risk:** 72% dependency on two categories (Electronics & Home).
> * **Opportunity:** High retention (80%) provides a safe base for experimental product launches.


**Key Findings**

Between **2020 and 2024**, the business demonstrates **high operational stability but limited scalability**.

* **Annual revenue remains within a narrow range:** **$18.2M–$18.5M**
* Average yearly order volume: **~20,000 orders**
* **Average Order Value (AOV): ~$920**

Despite stable performance across key metrics, **no meaningful organic growth is observed**. Revenue structure, customer volume, and demand levels remain **largely unchanged over five years**.

**Strategic Interpretation**

The company appears to operate in a **mature stage of its business lifecycle**. Operational processes are stable and **customer retention is strong**, but **new growth drivers are limited**.

Future expansion will likely require:

* new customer acquisition channels
* product portfolio expansion
* pricing or product strategy innovation

### 1. Revenue & Growth Dynamics

**Key Findings**

* **Annual revenue remained within a very narrow range:** **$18.17M–$18.53M** (less than **2% variation** across five years)
* Monthly revenue fluctuates between **$1.34M and $1.64M** without clear growth acceleration
* **Customers, Orders, and AOV remain structurally stable**
* No sustained increase in transaction volume or demand is observed

**Strategic Insights**

Revenue dynamics suggest that the business has reached a **performance plateau**. Stable order volume combined with consistent AOV indicates **predictable demand but limited expansion potential**.

---

### 2. Seasonality Analysis

**Key Findings**

Demand patterns show **consistent seasonality across all analyzed years**.

* **February** is consistently the **weakest month**, indicating a structural seasonal dip
* **May** regularly delivers **one of the highest revenue peaks**; in **2024 it reached $1.64M**
* **August** consistently performs above the annual average, forming a **secondary seasonal peak**
* **December 2024 shows an unusual revenue decline ($1.45M)** below the historical Q4 range

**Strategic Insights**

* Demand peaks appear to be **driven by specific months rather than extended holiday periods**
* The pattern may reflect **marketing campaign timing, product cycles, or market-specific events**
* The **December 2024 decline**, particularly in **Texas and California**, may indicate **competitive pressure, reduced marketing activity, or operational constraints**

---

### 3. Product & Category Performance

**Key Findings**

* **Electronics generates $9.5M revenue**, accounting for **~52% of total sales**
* Together with **Home & Kitchen ($3.6M)**, these two categories represent **~72% of total revenue**
* **Average Order Value remains similar across categories (~$900)**
* Revenue differences are primarily driven by **order volume rather than price**

Electronics dominates due to **sales volume**, generating **over 10,000 orders**, compared with **~4,000 orders in Home & Kitchen**.

**Strategic Insights**

* The business is **highly dependent on a single category**, creating **portfolio concentration risk**
* The current growth model is **volume-driven rather than price-driven**, suggesting potential to scale mid-tier categories **without major pricing changes**

---

### 4. Regional Performance

**Key Findings**

Revenue distribution shows **clear geographic concentration**.

* **Texas:** ~25% of revenue
* **California:** ~20% of revenue
* Together these states generate **~45% of total sales**

Shipping costs remain **highly consistent across states ($7.29–$7.50)**, indicating a **stable logistics structure**.

The **average cancellation rate is ~3%**, though some states show higher levels:

* **Indiana:** 4.24%
* **Ohio:** 3.93%

**Strategic Insights**

* **Texas and California act as primary growth hubs** for the business
* Higher cancellation rates in some states **do not correlate with shipping costs**, suggesting other drivers such as **traffic quality, product-market fit, or product page communication**
* **Washington shows the lowest cancellation rate**, potentially indicating **higher demand quality or stronger product-market alignment**

---

### 5. Retention & Repeat Purchase

**Key Findings**

A **significant shift in customer revenue composition occurred in 2024**.

* Returning customer revenue share increased from **69.3% (2023)** to **80.3% (2024)**
* New customer revenue share decreased from **30.7% to 19.7%**

**Strategic Insights**

The business has become **increasingly retention-driven**.

Customer loyalty appears strong, but **declining new-customer revenue may indicate slowing acquisition momentum**, which could **limit long-term scalability if the trend continues**.

---

## IV. Strategic Recommendations

Based on the analysis, **six strategic priorities** emerge for future business development.

**1. Establish a New Product Growth Driver**<br>
With revenue growth largely stagnant, the company should focus on creating additional revenue drivers within the existing portfolio.
Given the strong demand for Electronics, introducing premium SKUs, bundles, or higher-value configurations could increase Average Order Value and category depth.

**2. Reduce Category Concentration Risk**<br>
More than half of total revenue is generated by Electronics, creating structural dependency.
Expanding Home & Kitchen and adjacent categories could diversify revenue streams and strengthen portfolio resilience.

**3. Scale High-Performing Core Markets**<br>
Revenue is heavily concentrated in Texas and California, which act as the company’s primary growth markets.
Focused localized marketing investment and optimized advertising strategies could further scale performance in these regions.

**4. Further Monetize the Existing Customer Base**<br>
Returning customers already generate the majority of revenue.
Strengthening loyalty programs, email marketing, and subscription-based offers could increase customer lifetime value and repeat purchase frequency.

**5. Investigate Regional Order Cancellations**<br>
Higher cancellation rates in Indiana and Ohio suggest potential operational or behavioral issues.
A root-cause analysis of traffic sources, product communication, and customer expectations may help reduce order losses.

**6. Leverage Seasonality in Marketing Strategy**<br>
Demand shows clear seasonal patterns.
Targeted promotions during February (historically weak) and increased marketing investment during May and August (peak demand months) could improve overall revenue distribution.
